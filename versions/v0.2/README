SynthJackalope: If you're looking for the Discord theme made by @ᘛ⁐̤ᕐᐷ it's here, attached. It allows you to change the looks of your Discord client to resemble A HUGE SPOILER that you can find in SUPERHOT the original, non-VR game. We are very thankful Salt did this and it's a wonderful, very modern form of art. 

SynthJackalope: However, you should be aware that we cannot explicitly tell you how to use and install it since it involves using software that is officially against Discord TOS. We are not promoting breaching Discord TOS in any way and neither does the creator of the skin. This is an act of artistic freedom and community engagement done with only good intentions of letting their creativity be shown in a way beneficial to Discord community. 

SynthJackalope: Should there be any confusion as to legal/moral side of things concerning this endeavor, I implore you to contact me about it first as I was the one promoting this internally and externally on SUPERHOT Team's media.
